Pneumonia is the most significant reason behind death
worldwide although itâ€™s a vaccine-preventable disease. Analyzing
chest X-rays may be a difficult task and requires precision. An
improved and advanced AI system for pneumonia detection can go
a protracted way in decreasing the mortality and increasing
anticipation. The proposed paper presents a deep neural network
supported convolutional neural networks and residual network
together with techniques of identifying optimum differential rates
using cosine annealing and stochastic gradient with restarts to
achieve an efficient and highly accurate network which will help
detect and predict the presence of pneumonia using chest X-rays.

The Kaggle dataset employed consists of total, 5863 XRay images (JPEG) . The dataset structured into 3 parts
like train, test, and validation,contains sub folders for each
image category or class like Pneumonia or Normal. Chest
X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were looked over review
accomplices of pediatric patients of 1 to 5 years from
Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center,
Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was gathered and
executed as a major aspect of patients' normal clinical
consideration.

The proposed work will help doctors better predict
pneumonia in minimal time with high efficiency. The
aggregation of this can contribute to the health care system
for better patient satisfaction and care. This work is in its
early stages and may be improved by adding more images to
the dataset, incorporating better architectures, training the
model supported on more transformations and orientations.
Early diagnosis and treatment of diseases is critical to
preventing complications including death. With billions of
procedures per year, chest X-ray scans are one of the most
common and important diagnosis tools used in practice.
They are used for diagnosing and screening a variety of
diseases like pneumonia. Statistics by the World Health
Organization indicate that about two thirds of the global
population lacks access to proper X-ray diagnostics.
